# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Social-Media-Data

Dataset Description: Data has been gathered from Twitter related to the stock market crash of 2022, using the hashtag #stockmarketcrash. The dataset contains tweets categorized into three sentiment labels:

Positive: 12,542 tweets
Neutral: 11,498 tweets
Negative: 9,906 tweets

Objective: This assignment focuses on performing sentiment analysis on the provided dataset to classify tweets into one of the three categories: positive, neutral, or negative. You are required to use and compare different methods of sentiment analysis.

Tasks:

Data Preprocessing:
Preprocess the text as needed
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. For each sentiment label, randomly select 80% of the data for training; the remaining 20% will be used for testing. You need to report accuracy on testing data.
Techniques for Sentiment Analysis:
Frequency-Based Embeddings: Use Bag of Words and TF-IDF to vectorize the text (NLTK library). Select the top 100 features (words) using the chi-square test to refine your feature set.
Word Vectors: Employ pre-trained word vectors from Word2Vec and GloVe for feature representation. You may use vectors pretrained on Wikipedia or other corpora.
Sentence Vectors [optional bonus part]: Utilize advanced sentence pretrained embedding techniques such as the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE).
Implement the above methods of embeddings. Given these embeddings as features, train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the sentiment. Compare how the modelâ€™s accuracy changes with each embedding type. 
Deliverables:

Code: Submit a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script containing all the preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation code.
Report: Provide a comprehensive report that includes:
Methodology: Detailed description of your preprocessing steps, choice of vectorization methods, and model implementation.
Findings: Summary of model performance, including accuracy comparisons and discussions on why certain embeddings performed better than others. You can show examples from data to support your discussion.
Submission Guidelines:

Ensure that all code is well-commented and organized. 
Include all necessary libraries and dependencies required to run your code.
No cheating allowed. For plagiarism, we will be comparing your code with your peers and with the code generated by LLMs such as Chat-GPT.
Submit your report in PDF format, ensuring it is clearly structured and well-written.
